## How to Play

A Player can move its character by using arrow keys. Once the game loads, enemies will start to move. The player should pass through the enemies without a collision. If the player and any of enemies collide, the game will restart. Once the player gets to the land, then the player win and the game will restart. Also the player can change randomly its character by getting on a selector, which is located at lower right corner.
